# camunda-modeler-provisioner
> Setup a Camunda Modeler in any version preconfigured for your needs in no-time!

My vision is to provide an automated way of installation and configuration trough IDE or CLI to help in a multitude of use cases. No matter if you try to reproduce a bug, test your changes to modeler extension this tool should be your choice! 

## Development
Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) package manager to download and install required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To automatically lint and test your changes run the following:
```sh
npm run dev
```
As hint: Currently there is no test infrastructure, neither for the core logic nor for the CLI code. (I know, shame on me :( )

In case you want to try the CLI interface manually, you can ran the following command followed by your subcommand and parameters you would like to test:
```sh
npm run bin
```

## Usage
To be written (as binary as well trough code)
